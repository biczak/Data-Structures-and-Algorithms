# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
A collection of popular Data Structures and Algorithms expressed using JavaScript. Each data structure and algorithm comes with tests written to validate the accuracy and functionality. See the **Testing** section below for more information.

# Data Structures
  - Binary Search Tree
    - Add new Nodes to their appropriate locations
    - Search to see if the Tree contains a specific value
  - Linked List
    - Add a Node at the beginning
    - Add a Node at the end
    - Add a Node at the specified index
    - Check how many Nodes the Linked List contains
    - Return the first Node
    - Return the last Node
    - Return the Node at a specific index
    - Remove all Nodes
    - Remove the first Node
    - Remove the last Node
    - Remove the Node at a specific index
    - Execute a function on each Node
  - Queue
    - Add a record to the end
    - Remove a record from the front
  - Stack
    - Add a record to the top
    - Remove a record from the top
  - Tree
    - Add children to existing Nodes
    - Remove existing children from Nodes
    - Perform Breadth-First Traversal
    - Perform Depth-First Traversal

# Algorithms
  - Anagrams
    - Given two strings, determine if they are anagrams of one another
  - Capitalize
    - Capitalize the first letter of each word in a given string
  - Reverse Integer
    - Given an integer, return an integer that has the digits in reverse order
  - Vowels
    - Return the number of vowels present in a given string

## Testing
If you are interested in running the included unit tests, please follow these steps:
  - Install **Jest** with npm or your package manager of choice*
    - ```npm i jest --save-dev```
      
      or


    - ```yarn add jest -D```
  - Run the ```test``` command in your terminal
    - ```npm run test```

      or


    - ```yarn test```
  

    **\*** If you already have **Jest** installed globally on your machine, you can just run the ```jest``` command in your terminal.
